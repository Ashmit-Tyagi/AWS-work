## Summary

This task demonstrates how to create an Amazon S3 bucket using AWS CLI, upload a sample text file, and make it publicly accessible over the internet. Using commands like aws s3api create-bucket and aws s3 cp, you can manage file storage efficiently. By setting the object’s ACL to public-read or applying a bucket policy, the file becomes accessible via a public S3 URL, enabling easy sharing and static file hosting.
